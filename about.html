      Hi!
      IÂ´ll tell you a little about me!
    </span>
    I was born and raised in <strong>Chile</strong>, South America.
    Studied <strong>Hospitality</strong>, and worked as an executive caterer before I went to live abroad.
    I dedicated 7 years to my growing family, now two boys (5 and 3), my husband and me, in London, Chicago and now, Seattle.
    During that time I became a passionate knitter, baker and lego builder.
    At the time I am working very hard to became a <strong>Software Developer</strong> at <strong>Ada Developers Academy</strong>!! (love).
  </p>
